# Illinois Real Estate Price Prediction - Datathon FME 2024

## Challenge Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict real estate prices in Illinois. 
The challenge involves processing and analyzing housing data to create accurate price predictions.

We leverage Zillow's Home Value Index (ZHVI) data from zillow.com to enhance our model's predictive capabilities. The ZHVI provides a smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of typical home values across different geographic regions and time periods. By merging this data with our training dataset using postal codes and closing dates, we incorporate valuable market-level price trends that can help capture temporal and location-based patterns in housing prices.
